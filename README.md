## Problem Statement
Inspired by the new Tengah town as well as the up and coming Jurong Innovation District (JID), we aim to simulate traffic flow in the new towns to aid urban planners such as URA in their planning process. Through the usage of Netlogo we aim to simulate potential traffic flow and predict and prevent potential traffic build up when the new town becomes fully functional. Understanding that town planners would like to experiment and develop their most optimal plan, we have identified key parameters, such as number of lanes, traffic lights, and types of junctions, that will be added to the end user.

For the purpose of this project, we have decided to focus on a particular segment of the new Tengah town which incorporates the Plantation and Garden district as well as the main road, Tengah Boulevard, leading from PIE. We have chosen this region as this new district runs parallel to Jurong West Avenue 1 which is a popular road that receives a lot of traffic flow, hence when JID is built, we could potentially see the same traffic flow in the roads of the new district. Thus, we hope that with these simulations, we could identify and assist URA to build better road features that could help reduce traffic build up and provide a smooth traffic flow for road users.
